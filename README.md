# arXiv_OAI_PMH
arXiv Harvester extracts the archive files from arXiv in Dublin Core format. The code uses a predefined date: 2016-01-05 from which all the articles are downloaded into an xml file. The functionality of providing our own date can also be implemented with slight modifications in the code.
The xml file is split into many smallers files each consisting of an individual record. These records are stored as xml files in a directory.
